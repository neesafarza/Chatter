# ChatterApp!

## Codework assignment

Build a simple chat application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. Itâ€™s a single page, that opens in the browser, and shows the messages in colored bubbles (think something like WhatsApp). On one side the computer will generate a random conversation, on the other side the user can post messages. The screen automatically flows and follows the messages posted, like in all chat apps. Each message should also have a small indication of the time it was sent.

## Dependencies

- Any browser that can run Javascript (chrome etc.)
- IDE; needed for development

## Usage

To run simply open `index.html` in browser.
The computer will ask question and user will input answer.
Answer can be send by pressing enter or clicking send button.
Blank answer (including whitespace) will trigger the answer box border to turn red and the message will not be sent.
The computer will keep generating next questions after user send answer until the final question when a dialog will appear notifying the user. the program will then terminate and window will close.
