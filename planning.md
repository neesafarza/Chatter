#Goal

- Build a simple chat application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. 
- Itâ€™s a single page, that opens in the browser, 
- and shows the messages in colored bubbles (think something like WhatsApp). 
- On one side the computer will generate a random conversation, 
- on the other side the user can post messages. 
- The screen automatically flows and follows the messages posted, like in all chat apps. 
- Each message should also have a snall indication of the time it was sent.
